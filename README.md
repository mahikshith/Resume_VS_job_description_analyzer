I have applied for many data science jobs over linkedin and other job websites. 

Either the recruiters take too much time to respond or they reject me [we can't blame them, they are just looking out for company's interest]

Slowly realizing that rejection is part of the process , deep inside we know how skillful we are at understanding and implementing the code. 

I have built a simple job description VS resume analyzer using google's gemini 1.5 pro API : 

The main idea is to upload the resume in pdf format and copy the JD from a job portal and analyze the ATS score , skills to update on your resume and to provide recommendations. 

Here is the demo in streamlit : 

### Demo_1 :  Used Paypal Ml engineer role vs my resume  :

### Demo_2 : Jio Ml engineer vs my resume :

After resume Analyzer gave out it's insights , I felt confident about JIO ml engineer role and I applied for it , Let see what the future have in store for me ....
